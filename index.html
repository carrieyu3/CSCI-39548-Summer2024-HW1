You are to create a website about yourself. It should have a minimum of 3 pages in total, each linked to the other using hyperlinks.
Be sure to include images and appropriate css styles to make your website presentatable.
Throw in a couple of media queries to handle responsiveness. Make a note at the bottom of each page indicating what the media query you used does.
Fnd a free hosting service ( You can google hosting static webpages on AWS) and submit the link to the Blackboard.
